**Week 7 lab report**

Alex Zhang


**part 1**

I did the first task to change every "start" to "base" in DocSearchServer.java.


`/start<Enter>cebase<escape>n.n.n.:wq<Enter>`

my shortest key press combinations only involves 24 key presses including typing the name.

this is when you type /start and cursor jumps to the word start.

![img2](cse%2015l%20lab%207%20r2.png)
this is when you type c and e, it removes "start" and enter insert mode.

![img3](cse%2015l%20lab%207%20r3.png)
this then you type the word you want, which is base. then press escape to leave insert mode.

you press N to go to the next "start" and press "." to do the last edit again on this "start" you repeat as many times as you need until you have done it for all of them.

last step we can type : and wq to write and quit. which saves the changes and leaves vim.


**part 2**

**using scp**: 51.11 seconds

no difficulties as long as I have the scp command ready to go. writing the scp command maybe time consuming if you don't have it ready.


**using vim**: 45.82 seconds

no difficulties and as long as you read vimtutor ahead of time. there is no time consuming steps as long as you understand vim  commands.

Which I would prefer:

I prefer using vim to edit files on remote server just because I don't have to log in and out to save the changes on the remote server. Though vim is not the best place to edit, it is good for some small edits and changes that you want up on the server quickly.

What might affect my decision: 

if we were to work on larger projects and do a lot of edits I would rather do it locally and scp it up because it does not that much longer than using vim but you can edit files in a much better enviroment. I would still use vim to edit small changes to see quick results.
