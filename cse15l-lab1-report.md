CSE 15L lab 1 report
Alex Zhang

For this lab, we are supposed to learn about how to log into a server and run some commands using ssh.

Going into part 2 of the lab we may run into some troubles. You have to follow the instructions on how to reset your password. The first time I reset my password to the same password, and it didnâ€™t work for the whole lab period. Later in the day I tried it again and resetted all my passwords to a different password which finally worked, at the cost of changing my ucsd password as well.

Picture below is what you should see when you finish part 3, which is simply installing VS code. I have VS code already installed, but if not, just follow the instructions and download from the link provided.
